  Cloud-agnostic storage: This chart relies on PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)
  and the cluster's default StorageClass for dynamic provisioning.

  No cloud-specific PersistentVolume (PV) is created. The cluster's CSI driver
  or storage provisioner will handle volume creation automatically.

  Previously, this template contained a GCP-specific gcePersistentDisk PV.
  That has been removed to ensure the chart works on any Kubernetes cluster
  (on-prem, AWS, Azure, GCP, or any other platform).

  If you need to bind to a pre-existing volume, use:
    persistence.existingClaim: <your-pvc-name>
  Or set a specific storageClass:
    persistence.storageClass: <your-storage-class>
